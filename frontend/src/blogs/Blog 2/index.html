            <h2>What Is CBC?</h2>
            <p>A Complete Blood Count (CBC) is a blood test that helps evaluate your overall health and detect disorders such as anemia, infection, and other conditions affecting blood cells.</p>
            
            <h3>Why It's Done</h3>
            <p>A CBC test checks for abnormal increases or decreases in blood cell counts, which can indicate conditions like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anemia</li>
                <li>Infection</li>
                <li>Blood clotting disorders</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>The CBC test provides values for different blood components, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red Blood Cells (RBC)</strong>: Low RBC count may indicate anemia.</li>
                <li><strong>White Blood Cells (WBC)</strong>: High WBC count may suggest infection or inflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>Platelets</strong>: Low platelet count may indicate clotting disorders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Is Anemia?</h2>
            <p>Anemia is a condition where the body has a lower-than-normal red blood cell count or hemoglobin level, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the bodyâ€™s organs.</p>
            
            <h3>Symptoms of Anemia</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
                <li>Pale or yellowish skin</li>
                <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
                <li>Cold hands and feet</li>
                <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types and Causes</h3>
            <p>There are over 400 types of anemia, classified into three main categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anemia due to blood loss:</strong> Caused by conditions like ulcers, heavy menstruation, or internal bleeding.</li>
                <li><strong>Anemia due to faulty RBC production:</strong> Includes iron-deficiency anemia, sickle cell anemia, and vitamin B12 deficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Anemia due to RBC destruction:</strong> Hemolytic anemia, which can be caused by infections, autoimmune diseases, or genetic disorders.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>Anemia is typically diagnosed through a Complete Blood Count (CBC) test, which measures red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and other blood components.</p>

            <h2>How to Treat Anemia</h2>
            <p>Treatment depends on the type and severity of anemia:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Iron-Deficiency Anemia:</strong> Iron supplements and a diet rich in iron.</li>
                <li><strong>Sickle Cell Anemia:</strong> Medications like hydroxyurea, pain management, and sometimes blood transfusions.</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin-Deficiency Anemia:</strong> Vitamin B12 or folic acid supplements.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe Anemia:</strong> Blood transfusions or bone marrow transplants in extreme cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Diet & Home Remedies for Anemia</h2>
            <p>Eating an iron-rich diet can help prevent and manage anemia. Some iron-rich foods include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meats (beef, chicken, turkey)</li>
                <li>Leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale)</li>
                <li>Iron-fortified cereals</li>
                <li>Legumes (beans, lentils, peas)</li>
                <li>Eggs and seafood</li>
                <li>Nuts and dried fruits</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Anemia complications</h2>
            <p>Anemia can lead to severe tiredness, making it very hard to get through your day. It can also lead to an arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. Because there isn't as much oxygen in the blood, the heart must pump more, which could lead to heart failure. Anemia can even be fatal, especially if you lose a lot of blood too quickly. </p>

            <h2>Anemia & Pregnancy</h2>
            <p>When you get pregnant, your body goes through many changes. Your body produces 20% to 30% more blood, which means you need more iron and vitamins.</p>
            <p>A lot of people don't have enough iron for their second and third trimesters, which could lead to anemia. While mild anemia is normal during pregnancy, severe anemia could put your baby at risk for anemia as well.</p>
            <p>If you're severely anemic during your first two trimesters, you're at a higher risk of having a preterm delivery or a baby with a low birth weight. People who are pregnant and anemic are also at a higher risk of blood loss during labor and may have a harder time fighting infections.</p>
            <p>During pregnancy, you need 27 milligrams of iron each day. You can take prenatal vitamins that contain iron to help prevent or treat an iron deficiency during pregnancy. Your doctor might also give you a different iron supplement. You can also eat more iron-rich foods to help with your iron deficiency.</p>
            <p>If you do these things and still have anemia, your doctor might suggest testing to find other potential causes. If your anemia is due to iron deficiency, they'll have you take more iron supplements. But if you had a history of gastric bypass, small bowel surgery, or you aren't able to take an iron supplement, your doctor will give you iron through an IV (intravenous) needle.</p>
