            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection, and leukemia. This test measures several components and features of your blood, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red blood cells (RBCs):</strong> Carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.</li>
                <li><strong>White blood cells (WBCs):</strong> Fight infection and are part of your immune system.</li>
                <li><strong>Hemoglobin (Hgb):</strong> The oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells.</li>
                <li><strong>Hematocrit (Hct):</strong> The proportion of red blood cells to the fluid component (plasma) in your blood.</li>
                <li><strong>Platelets:</strong> Help with blood clotting to stop bleeding.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="why-its-done">
            <h2>Why It's Done</h2>
            <p>Doctors may recommend a CBC for various reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To assess overall health:</strong> As part of a routine medical examination to monitor general health.</li>
                <li><strong>To diagnose a medical condition:</strong> If you're experiencing symptoms like weakness, fatigue, fever, inflammation, bruising, or bleeding, a CBC can help determine the cause.</li>
                <li><strong>To monitor a medical condition:</strong> If you've been diagnosed with a blood disorder affecting blood cell counts, a CBC can help monitor your condition.</li>
                <li><strong>To monitor medical treatment:</strong> A CBC may be used to monitor your health if you're taking medications that may affect blood cell counts.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="preparation">
            <h2>How You Prepare</h2>
            <p>If your blood sample is being tested only for a CBC, you can eat and drink normally before the test. If your blood sample will be used for additional tests, you may need to fast for a certain amount of time before the test. Your doctor will provide specific instructions.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="expectations">
            <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
            <p>During a CBC, a healthcare professional will take a blood sample by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm, usually at the bend of your elbow. The blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis. You can return to your usual activities immediately after the test.</p>

            <h2>Not a Definitive Test</h2>
            <p>A complete blood count, also called a CBC, usually doesn't give all the answers about a diagnosis. Results outside the expected range may or may not need follow-up. A health care provider might need to look at the results of other tests as well as the results of a CBC.</p>
            <p>For example, results slightly outside the typical range on a CBC might not be of concern for someone who's healthy and has no symptoms of illness. Follow-up might not be needed. But for someone having cancer treatment, the results of a CBC outside the expected range might signal a need to change the treatment.</p>

        <section id="indications">
            <h2>What the Results May Indicate</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit:</strong> Lower than usual levels could indicate anemia, which may be caused by low levels of iron or vitamins, blood loss, or another medical condition. Higher than usual levels may suggest blood cancer or heart disease.</li>
                <li><strong>White blood cell count:</strong> A low count (leukopenia) may result from autoimmune diseases, bone marrow disorders, or cancer. A high count may indicate infection, inflammation, or a reaction to medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Platelet count:</strong> A low count (thrombocytopenia) or high count (thrombocytosis) may indicate an underlying medical condition or a side effect of medication.</li>
